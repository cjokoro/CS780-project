This is our project for CS780 - Advanced Software Engineering   

To run this application you will need to have two terminals open. One terminal will be for the "dpp" file and the other for the "react-app" file.   
Firstly, the imports. You will need to do these imports for both the terminals:   
npm install
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
npm install react-router-dom
npm install axios
npm install react react-dom

Next, in the "react-app" terminal type "npm run dev". Then in the "dpp" terminal type "npm start"   
This should open up a window taking you to the login page.   

Before logging in, you must connect the backend. Go to (https://github.com/atishshahrouniyar/cs780-project-backend) and follow the instructions on the README.
